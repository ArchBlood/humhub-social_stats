# Social Stats
This module provides general statistics on overall activity, with charts of hourly and daily activity

### Please Note

Historical data will take time to populate!  
you will see the chart build up every day..  
The first day, it'll look empty..

This is where Master Yoda should intervene with some sort of aphorism about patience..
